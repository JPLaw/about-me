<h1>All About Me</h1>
		<div id="content">
			<h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p> Hi there! My name is Jenny, and I am venturing into the world of software development. I have been working in non profit for the last 8 years, and I am excited to be trying something new. This is my first webpage! It took a lot of trial and error (mostly error), but this is the result. I was able to code all the HTML and CSS in order to make it, and as my coding improves, so will this web page.</p>
      <hr />
      <p> When I am not dabbling in web development, I am usually partaking in some of my hobbies, which include reading, photography, hiking, camping, playing or watching sports, and hanging out with friends. I also LOVE to travel, and you can find a list of places I would like to go below!</p>
